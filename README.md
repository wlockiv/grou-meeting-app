# Group App

## What

"Group App" (best name _ever_) is an app where people can create "groups" that have events. Once a group gets created, 
its owner will be able to invite others to subscribe to the group. Once someone has subscribed to a group, they'll be 
notified about events the group is having based on some basic notification preferences.

## Why

If I ever use this for my own purposes, it'll be to encourage people to show up to things that they commit to.

However, the purpose of the project is more about learning the AWS Amplify toolkit, and probably Twilio.
